# Optimizations:
### General
- Cache Coherence: Use cache-coherent RISC-V cores to ensure consistent data across multiple processors, crucial for parallel processing in AI and ML.

- Vector extensions: Utilize RISC-V vector extensions like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) to parallelize data manipulations in AI and AR/VR.

- Memory hierarchy: Design a layered memory hierarchy with caches, DRAM, and potentially non-volatile memory (NVM) for efficient data access based on application needs (e.g., low latency for AR/VR vs. high bandwidth for IoT).

### AI/ML Applications:
Use RISC-Vâ€™s Vector Extension (RVV): The RVV provides support for vector operations, which are crucial for AI/ML workloads. You can use libraries that take advantage of these extensions to optimize your AI/ML applications.

Hardware accelerators: Utilize RISC-V compatible hardware accelerators like GPUs or NPUs for offloading computationally intensive tasks, freeing up the main processor for other operations.
Data compression: Implement lightweight data compression techniques on-chip to reduce memory bandwidth requirements in data-intensive AI applications.
### IoT Applications:

Design a RISC-V SoC Architecture: Tailor your RISC-V SoC architecture towards IoT applications. This could involve optimizing for low power consumption, small footprint, and real-time processing.

Low-power RISC-V cores: Choose low-power RISC-V cores for battery-powered IoT devices to optimize energy consumption while processing sensor data.

Real-time processing: Prioritize real-time data processing with efficient cache management and interrupt handling to ensure timely responses in time-sensitive IoT applications.

Implement Security Features: Implement security-sensitive edge computational operations while targeting a small-footprint implementation of security features over performance.

### AR/VR Applications:

Use High-End Graphics Rendering: Use application-specific RISC-V processors with customization tools for high-end graphics rendering, which is crucial for AR/VR applications.

High-bandwidth memory: Utilize high-bandwidth memory interfaces like LPDDR5 or HBM2e to handle the massive data streams required for rendering complex AR/VR environments.

Predictable memory access: Ensure predictable memory access times through techniques like real-time cache management and memory prioritization to avoid visual stutters and latency issues in AR/VR applications.

Specialized instructions: Explore custom instructions or dedicated hardware for real-time image processing and 3D graphics rendering to improve AR/VR performance.

### Optimizing Data Mobility:
Use DMA Engines: Use Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines for high-bandwidth data transfers between a Domain-Specific Accelerator (DSA) and memory. This can help in reducing the latency and improving the overall system performance.

 #### Method 1: Neural CPU (NCPU) (ref:NCPU.pdf)
The
proposed architecture is built on a binary neural network
accelerator with the capability to emulate an in-order RISC-V
CPU pipeline. The NCPU supports flexible programmability of
RISC-V and maintains data locally to avoid costly core-to-core
data transfer. -> (2 mode on one NCPU : CPU for general purpose and binary neural network accelerator). 
- Idea:
  - Leverage the existing logic and
memories inside a neural network accelerator to recover the
capability of conventional CPU pipeline operations. As a result,
a NCPU core supports both ML inference and general-purpose
CPU computing with efficiency similar to the respective
architectures.
  - The proposed NCPU architecture is designed to fully
support the 32-bit RISC-V Base ISA. A customized RISC-V
instruction set extension is developed to incorporate BNN
operations, data transferring and mode switching.
  - A special zero-latency transition scheme is developed to
support seamless switching between CPU and BNN modes by
essentially pipelining the reconfiguration. Data can remain in
place while the core is reconfiguring thereby eliminating
transfer between CPU and accelerator.
