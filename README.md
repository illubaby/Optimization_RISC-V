# Optimization of Data Mobility in Embedded Machine Learning Systems for IoT Applications

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the project "Tối ưu hóa truyền dữ liệu trong các hệ thống máy học nhúng cho các ứng dụng IoT" (Optimization of Data Mobility in Embedded Machine Learning Systems for IoT Applications). Our work explores the RISC-V architecture to enhance data mobility between CPU, ML engine, and memory in embedded systems, particularly for IoT applications.

## Project Description
RISC-V, an open-source hardware instruction set architecture based on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, offers a simple yet customizable base architecture. This project aims to leverage RISC-V for AI, ML, IoT, and AR/VR applications by optimizing data mobility to improve overall system performance.

### Key Objectives
- **Study RISC-V Architecture**: Investigating the structure and capabilities of RISC processors.
